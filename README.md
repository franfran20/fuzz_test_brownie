# fuzz_test_brownie
A template for writing fuzz tests using brownie' in-built hypothesis methods. This produces way more powerful tests than usual!

# More powerful tests!
Going into the tests folder you'd see the fuzz_test file. Its a basic template for powerful tests you could do with hypothesis and brownie! There are also comments in there if you're a bit lost
